                <h3>Project</h3>
                <p>Inspired by the tale Snow-White and Rose-Red, the player embodies a puppeteer who has committed a horrible crime finds himself performing the same play over and over in front of the same audience as punishment. 
                    The player will have to make the right decisions to hope for the audience's forgiveness.<br />
                </p>
                <p>Plunged into a dark universe, the player takes on the role of a puppeteer serving his sentence in his own personal hell.
                    In his past life, this puppeteer, owner of a puppet theater, perpetrated an unspeakable sexual crime. Having dared to prey on children, he deserves his 
                    punishment. As his punishment takes the form of his darkest weaknesses, he finds himself having to perform the same play in front of an audience who will 
                    judge him unceasingly, inflicting eternal torment on him.
                    The play takes the form of a tale subtly twisted to reflect his guilt, where the puppets represent both the victims, the projection of his being and 
                    judgment, and his executioners.
                </p>
                <h3>Personal Feedback</h3>
                <p>Unfortunately, we couldn't bring this concept to prototype stage due to the artistic ambitions being too high for student designers, including elements 
                    like hell, theater, and puppets. Nevertheless, it remains one of the projects I cherished most during my academic years. I found immense pleasure in 
                    the freedom to draw from existing tales, reshaping them to fit our narrative and gameplay vision.<br />
                    Given my affinity for personifications and metaphors in storytelling, I infused this scenario with my own creative desires. This aspect stands out to me as one of the highlights of working on this concept.
